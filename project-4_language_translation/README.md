In this project, you’re going to take a peek into the realm of _neural network machine translation_ . Here we train a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

# Concepts Used:
 - Recurrent Neural Networks
 - LSTMs
 - Transfer Learning
 - Reinforcement Learning
